# LearningHTML
Collection of short (2-3 hours) projects that I am using to teach myself html/css basics


As it stands, I have a fair amount of experience with object oriented programming in Java, especially with basic sorting algorithms, Abstract Data Types, and objhect interactions. Recently, I have seen immense value in using HTML and Javascript as a primary language in order to more easily create individual projects with a functioning frontend that can be easily hosted on the web. Though these projects are very simple, they serve as a mechanism to learn the syntax and behaviors of HTML and CSS. 

I plan to come back to these projects intermittently depending on the difficulties that I encounter with future endeavors. (In other words, this "collection" may remain the two short works)
